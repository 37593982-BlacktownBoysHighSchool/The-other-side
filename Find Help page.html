      <h3>Anxiety</h3>
      <a href="https://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/resources-support/anxiety/help-support/" target="_blank"> Anxiety is a common mental health condition characterized by excessive worry, fear, or nervousness. It goes beyond the normal stress or apprehension people may feel in certain situations. Individuals with anxiety often experience persistent and intense feelings of uneasiness, restlessness, or a sense of impending doom. Physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, muscle tension, trembling, sweating, and difficulty concentrating may also accompany anxiety. There are various types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Like depression, anxiety can be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Treatment for anxiety may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both, depending on the severity of symptoms. Seeking professional help is important for managing and addressing anxiety effectively.Click to find help.</a>

      <h3>Substance</h3>
      <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/aod/Pages/contact-service.aspx" target="_blank">Substance addiction, also known as substance use disorder, is a chronic and relapsing condition characterized by an individual's compulsive and harmful use of substances such as drugs or alcohol despite negative consequences. Addiction involves both physical and psychological dependence on the substance. Over time, individuals with substance addiction may develop a tolerance, requiring larger amounts to achieve the same effects, and experience withdrawal symptoms when not using the substance. The behavioral patterns associated with substance addiction often interfere with daily life, relationships, and responsibilities. The causes of addiction are complex and can involve genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Common substances that can lead to addiction include alcohol, nicotine, prescription medications, and illicit drugs. Treatment for substance addiction typically involves a combination of behavioral therapy, counseling, support groups, and, in some cases, medication. Overcoming addiction requires a comprehensive and individualized approach, as recovery is a lifelong process that involves addressing the physical, emotional, and social aspects of the disorder. Seeking professional help is crucial for those struggling with substance addiction to achieve and maintain recovery. Click to find help.</a>
